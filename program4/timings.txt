I believe these results are slighly impacted by some weird CPU optimizations that are occuring... I'm not exactly sure though.

Red Black Tree Lookup times:
Nodes		Time(microseconds)
100			39.603μs
1000		55.108μs
10000		38.62μs
100000		5.165μs
1000000		4.371μs

Unsorted Linked List Lookup times: (For Comparision Purposes)
Items		Time(microseconds)
100			20.419μs
1000		21.54μs
10000		35.03μs
100000		5.177μs
1000000		5.586μs

It seems that under a larger amount of entiries, the Red Black Tree is slightly faster than the Unsorted Linked List. Although, under the opposite circumstances, where the amount of enteries is smaller, the Unsorted Linked List is slightly faster than the Red Black Tree.
